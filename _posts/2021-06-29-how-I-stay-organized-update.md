I originally wrote this post in 2017, you can read the original version [here](http://aurielfournier.github.io/how-i-stay-organized/).

I've long been a bit of an over enthusiastic adopter of productivity systems, and hacks. During my PhD I had to make a rule for myself to stop switching systems, as it became a 'productive' form of procrastination, which helped no one, least of all me. 
  
Much of my system from 2017 persists, I remain a very tech centric organizer, though I fully acknowledge that tech based solutions aren't for everyone, and know many folks who use something similar to Raul Pacheco-Vega's Everything Notebook [link here](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/08/starting-up-and-maintaining-an-everything-notebook/). 

My central hub remains [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/), and it remains the places where I file away the things I think of while not at work, so that I don't have to keep dwelling on them until I'm back at work. I also organize a fair bit of my personal life reminders on Todoist, from when the dogs need their flea and tick meds, to my weekly grocery list. 

I will admit that I have been a heavy Todoist user for the better part of 5 years now, and I haven't looked at the other options that are out there, because I remain really happy with what Todoist does, and the new features that are coming out. The way Todoist handles reoccurring tasks is super helpful to me, its multi-platform and works with multiple people well, and they've recently rolled out boards which has been huge for helping me do a better job of managing information as well as tasks. For instance I have one project which is just grants, and its set up as a board, with multiple columns, one column is just full of all the grant report deadlines (oh so many grant reports), so those are there, and I can look at them if I want, but they aren't filling up other places. Each grant also has a column where things that need to be done, or notes I need to keep near by are kept. 

I also have a project board for the field station, one for the Firebird project (a very large project I lead), and a project board for all the service work I do for [GoMAMN](gomamn.org) where I'm currently Chair, and [Wilson Ornithological Society](wilsonsociety.org) where I am 2nd VP. I have a graduate students board, where each student has a column, and after our regular checkins I can update the notes in their column with the relevent notes, so that my terrible memory has a record of what is going on, and I can also add tasks there that the student needs from me. 


I also have two spreadsheets I maintain, one is a 'five-year' plan (really more like a decadal plan at this point since some of my service commitments run through 2029), where I can plop in things like conferences I want to attend, grant reporting deadlines (why are there so many reports?), when students are starting/defending, major service committements, as well as when I plan to take vacations, family weddings and events. I got got that idea from [The Professor Is In](http://theprofessorisin.com/2014/05/02/why-you-need-a-5-year-plan/). This helps me see the bigger picture all at once, and identify what times of year are already really tight, in a way taht looking at my calendar doesn't always represent well. I check this weekly, its one of my reoccurring Monday tasks. Its also where I track how I'm doing on the metrics I'm evaluated on each year (papers published, grant dollars awarded, presentations given), and it calculates the 3 year averages as well. 

I also have a spreadsheet where I keep track of all my projects, what the status is, who has it right now (especially helpful for manuscripts), when we next expect to meet/when I am next expected to contribute, what journals have rejected them, who I suggested for reviewers, etc. I got that idea from Alex Bond. I check this at least once a day, sometimes many times a day depending on what project I am working on in that moment.

I've also found these books very helpful in how I think about time management/organization

I've been in this job two years and I'm still figuring out the best way to stay on thop of the 15+ projects we're running at any given time, and all the administrative and facilities tasks that go into a field station. For me the central theme in all of this is, if I don't write it down I will *not* remember it, and I am a very visual person, so having a system that sets things up visually so I can quickly find what I need without digging through a dozen emails, is SUPER helpful.
