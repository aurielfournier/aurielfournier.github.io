title: Goals for 2013
---

So this year I'm trying to set some ambitious and varied goals, both professional and personal, just to set out what I hope this year will bring. I know that likely all of this won't happen, and that new adventures and things will present themselves as well,  and I am excited for all of them.

So here is to 2013!

- Try two new recipes every month (and write blog posts about them)
- Hike to the highest point in Arkansas & Missouri
      Larger goal - hike to the highpoint in all 50 states 
          already complete (Hawaii, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan)
- Hike the five best hikes in Arkansas (according to my guide book)
- Go to 10 new states  

         Larger goal - all 50 states by the time I'm 25
            Remaining: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Montana, Colorado,   
            Wyoming, Washington, Idaho, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska, 
            Tennessee
