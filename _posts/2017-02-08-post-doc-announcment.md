I am thrilled to announce that I have accepted a two year post doc at Mississippi State University, based in Biloxi, MS working as part of the Gulf of Mexico Avian Monitoring Network. 

More info on GOMAMN can be found [here](https://globalchange.ncsu.edu/secsc/projects/measuring-effects-of-restoration-and-ecological-change-on-bird-populations-in-the-gom/) and [here](https://gulfcoastprairielcc.org/media/29030/gomamn-2-pager-final-v2.pdf).

I'll be mainly working on the continued development of Structured Decision Making Tools to inform the monitoring of avian species across a wide variety of taxa for the forseeable future.

I start April 10th!
