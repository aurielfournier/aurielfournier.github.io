title: First Video of the Season #MORails
---

We have a GoPro Camera loaned to us this fall and we are using it to capture video of our survey methods so we can better share how we do what we do with everyone. 

My first attempt at stringing together some clips didn't go too smoothly, but here it is if anyone is interested. Not sure why the entire video did not upload. I'll try to figure it out this weekend.
