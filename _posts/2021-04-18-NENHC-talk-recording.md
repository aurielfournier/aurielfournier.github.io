I gave a talk at the Northeast Natural History Conference this past weekend, which is also the joint meeting of the Wilson Ornithological Society and Association of Field Ornithologists this year. 

The recording of my talk, with closed captions, is available here on [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8821tduw1b3slfn/Fournier%20NENHC%202021_small.mp4?dl=0). 

I talked about unpaid labor in STEM, why its a problem, and highlighted some groups who are doing good work in this space.
