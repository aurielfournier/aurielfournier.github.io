Back in February I was working on [tweeting from R](http://aurielfournier.github.io/auto-tweeting/) on behalf of the Wilson Ornithological Society, as I'm the person who tweets about new articles in the Wilson Journal of Ornithology. 

The past week I've finally worked out the web scraping part, so that I can automatically pull the article titles and the urls to the articles! 

I built a simple repo that includes all the code, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/aurielfournier/wilson_ornithological_society_tweets)
