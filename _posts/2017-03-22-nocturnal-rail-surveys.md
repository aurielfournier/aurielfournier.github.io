Rails are nitoriously difficult to detect, and while great methods have been developed for the breeding season, autumn migration is still a challenge. Based on previous work that showed that ATVs do well flushing birds at night for capture we designed a flushing survey protocal which can generate density estimates and allow us to ask questions about habitat use and migratory timing.
