Just returned from a great meeting in Corpus Christi, Texas and the annual meeting of the Society of Wetland Scientists. I've never been to SWS before and it was a wonderful and informative meeting and great chance to break out of my often very bird focused bubble and think about wetlands in some new ways. 

The slides from my presentation can be found [here](https://figshare.com/articles/Habitat_Use_of_Autumn_Migrating_Sora_in_the_Mississippi_Flyway/3398683)
