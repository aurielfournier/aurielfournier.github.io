Last week I had the pleasure of giving an invited talk to Bird Studies Canada reflecting on my ongoing collaboration with BSC and how I've used social media to communicate about our project. The slides are available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/_MORails_Sharing_Rails_with_Social_Media/5001029).
