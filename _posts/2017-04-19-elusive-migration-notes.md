Last year for the Ohio Ornithological Society and this year for The Biggest Week in American Birding I'm giving a keynote talk entited "Elusive Migration: The Migration Ecology of Rails" 

Its aimed at a non-academic audience, and as a result doesn't include a lot of the fine details that I could easily spend an hour talking about, instead if highlights the take home messages from the work I've done on rails, and some neat natural history. I've had a few people ask me for more details on the research I present in this talk, and so I'm going to use this post as a place to point those people towards. 

Fall migration survey method: 

Fournier, A.M.V., Krementz, D.G. 2017 Nocturnal Distance sampling All-Terrain Vehicle Surveys for Non-Breeding Rails The Wildlife Society Bulletin 41:151-156 doi:10.1002/wsb.745 [pdf link](https://github.com/aurielfournier/aurielfournier.github.io/blob/master/_pdfs/Fournier_et_al-2017-Wildlife_Society_Bulletin.pdf)

Migratory Connectivity with stable isotopes and species distribution models:

Fournier, A.M.V, Sullivan, A., Bump, J., Perkins, M., Shieldcastle, M.C., King, S. 2017 Combining citizen science species distribution models and stable isotopes reveals migratory connectivity in the secretive Virginia rail Journal of Applied Ecology 54:618-627 doi:10.1111/1365-2664.12723 [pdf link](https://github.com/aurielfournier/aurielfournier.github.io/blob/master/_pdfs/Fournier%20et%20al.%20-%202016%20-%20Journal%20of%20Applied%20Ecology.pdf)

Rails in Ohio:

Baseline Mercury Levels:

Brasso, R. 2016 Levels of Mercury in Feathers of Clapper Rails (Rallus crepitans) over 45 Years in Coastal Salt Marshes of New Hanover County, North Carolina Bulletin of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology 97: 469-473 doi 10.1007/s00128-016-1870-z [pdf link](https://github.com/aurielfournier/aurielfournier.github.io/blob/master/_pdfs/Fournier%20et%20al.%20-%202016%20-%20Bulletin%20of%20Environmental%20Contamination%20and%20Toxicology.pdf)
