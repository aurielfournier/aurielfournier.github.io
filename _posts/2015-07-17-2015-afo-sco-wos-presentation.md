I'm giving a presentation today at the Association of Field Ornithology / Society of Canadian Ornithologists / Wilson Ornithological Society Joint Meeting in Wolfville, Nova Scotia today. 

Its covering part of my first dissertation chapter, looking at the timing and habitat use of Sora during autumn migration.
