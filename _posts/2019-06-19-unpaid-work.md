**Fournier, A.M.V.,** Bond, A.L., Holford, A, Leighton, M. [*Unpaid work and access to science professions*](https://github.com/aurielfournier/aurielfournier.github.io/blob/master/_pdfs/Fournier_et_al_2019_PlosOne.pdf) **PLoS ONE** 14(6): e0217032.

What started as an editorial by Alex Bond and I back in 2015, published in the Wildlife Society Bulletin, grew into an amazing collaboration with Alex, myself and two wonderful economists, Dr. Angus Holford and Dr. Margaret Leighton. We've all learned a ton from each other, and about careers in science over the past 2+ years of working together. 

Our hope is that this work will inspire more work into this important topic, as well as policy changes within STEM organizations and institutions.
