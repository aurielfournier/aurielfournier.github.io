One of the cool things that we've documented on my project is Yellow Rails in many places and in numbers that we did not expect. We observed over 30 of them in 2012 and 6 of them in 2013 (sadly in 2013 we probably missed several due to the federal shutdown).

Recently we found out that the Yellow Rails we observed/captured the past two falls were noteworthy for more then just my dissertation.

The two Yellow Rails we banded in Missouri last fall were only the 2nd and 3rd Yellow Rails ever banded in the state! How cool is that!

The Missouri Rare Birds Record Committee recently accepted two records from my project. My technician in 2012, Justin Lehman, saw more Yellow Rails in one day then anyone else has seen during the fall in Missouri!

And the very first Yellow Rail observed on my project is the earliest fall record for the species in the state (during fall migration).

While Yellow Rails aren't the main focus of my dissertation, I am really excited to be able to try and learn as much about them as possible since we know very little about them, and even less about them during migration.

I'll leave you with this awesome picture, taken by my technician Nick when he caught the first Yellow Rail of 2013. It was also his lifer Yellow Rail, which made it even more exciting.
