I along with an amazing team are thrilled to announce that we're receiving a grant from NOAA RESTORE for ["Fire Effects in Gulf of Mexico Marshes - Historical Perspectives, Management, and Monitoring of Mottled Ducks and Black and Yellow Rails"(https://restoreactscienceprogram.noaa.gov/projects/marsh-birds-and-fire)

I've added a new page to [this website](https://aurielfournier.github.io/noaa_firebird/) where I'll compile job ads for full time, and seasonal positions as well as graduate positions with myself and other members of the team.
