2019 has been a year of big changes, big challenges, big opportunities and big growth. The whole human and dog family moved to Illinois with me in June, and I've made it 6 months in the new job now, and I love it. The team here at Forbes Biological Station is fantastic, I'm learning a ton, getting new projects started, and learning how to be a good Director/supervisor/support to the rest of the team here.

## Top moments

Landing my [dream job](http://aurielfournier.github.io/new-job/).  

Continued to learn to say 'No'. 

Being awarded my first [big grant](http://aurielfournier.github.io/noaa-firebird-announcement/).

Winning the battle against the rats in my house in Mississippi.

Time with great colleagues at meetings and conferences

**Visited Alaska for the first time** (states still needed: South Dakota)

Publishing our second paper on [unpaid labor in STEM](http://aurielfournier.github.io/unpaid-work/)

## Low Points

Leaving behind our amazing community in Mississippi.

Moving (it is the worst). 

The loneliness that comes from moving to a new state and not yet having formed a group of friends. 

Struggling with major imposter syndrome, depression and burn out.
