**Fournier, AMV**, Eulinger, K, McDaniel, T, Calvert, G.  [*Juvenile King Rail (Rallus elegans) in stomach of American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus)*](https://github.com/aurielfournier/aurielfournier.github.io/blob/master/_pdfs/Fournier_et_al_2019_Herpetological_Review.pdf) **Herpetological Review** 50:338


What started with a wetland manager showing me some photos on his phone, turned into this neat natural history note. First known record of a King Rail being eaten by a American Bullfrog!

They didnt' include our photos in the paper, so they are included here.
