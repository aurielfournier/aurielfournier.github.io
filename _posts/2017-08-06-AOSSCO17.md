Just returned from the first meeting of the American Ornithological Society (after the recent merger of AOU and COS), joined by the Society of Canadian Ornithologists to form a fantastic and fun meeting in East Lansing Michigan. 

I was very busy all week.

First I helped run the Social Media and Science Communication Symposium Wednesday. 

My Slides are available [here](https://figshare.com/articles/_MORails_MOScience_Tweeting_Live_From_The_Field/5236579). 

Slides from the entire symposium are available [here](https://figshare.com/account/home#/collections/3828799)

I also had the pleasure of giving a 3 minute lightning talk introducing myself to ornithology as an early career professional. The entire symposium can be watched [here Via SciCommMonday](https://www.pscp.tv/ScicommMonday/1vAxRNYZONDxl?).

Thursday I had a poster highlighting my 2015 paper in Waterbirds with Black Swamp Bird Observatory, available [here](https://figshare.com/articles/Comparison_of_Arrival_Dates_of_Rail_Migration_in_the_Southwest_Lake_Erie_Marshes/4726315).

Friday I helped run a Q&A about social media and science, well attended with a great discussion. 

Saturday I gave a talk on my postdoc work on structured decision making [available here](https://figshare.com/articles/Application_Of_Structured_Decision_Making_to_Marsh_Bird_Monitoring_in_The_Gulf_of_Mexico/5189374).

It was a wonderful meeting, full of friends and new faces.
