title: Master of Science - Statistics and Analytics 
---

I'm really excited to announce that I'm going to be pursuing a Masters of Science in Statistics and Analytics during my time here at the University of Arkansas. My graduation date is being pushed back to spring 2017 because of an additional year of funding so I will be able to add in the required classes for this masters degree.

Talking about this makes me want to go back and talk to myself my freshman year of undergrad when I took my first statistics course and really struggled with it, and didn't understand why it was important. Luckily I moved past that, learned stats wasn't all doing things by hand and could be really useful and now I really enjoy it. 

So here's to learning more about the wonderful world of statistics! 

More details on the program I'm apart of can be found [here](http://grad.uark.edu/stan/). I'll be part of the Bioanalytics track, pending approval by the state.
