title: New Paper - Virginia and Yellow Rail autumn migration ecology - synthesis using multiple data sets
comments: true
---

My latest paper is now available in Animal Migration. It details the autumn migration ecology, including the migratory timing and habitat use of Virginia and Yellow Rails in Missouri through five years of data I collected, compared with other sources of data since despite five years off data collection we still had a fairly small sample size.
