Field Season 2013 By The Numbers

- Nights of Surveying - 48
- Surveys Completed - 279 (that's right, 3 times as many as last year!)
- Miles Driven - ~7500
- Veg Points - Just under 1000
- Successful Helicopter Flights - 7
- Helicopter Crashes - 1 (not into the water!)

- Yellow Rails - 5
- Virginia Rails - 24
- King Rails - 1
- Sora - 1562

- Tires Replaced - Three (Two Trailer, One ATV)
- Trips to the Honda/Polaris Dealership to get something fixed - Three? Four? Lets just leave it at far too many
- Longest Stretch we didn't have all four ATVs working - Two Weeks
- Tires Repaired - far to many to count
- ATVs dunked in a ditch - 1
- Phones lost during ATV dunking - 1
- Spotlights repaired - again far to many, I have an entire box of broken spotlights (aka parts for 2014)
- Wallets Lost - ZERO (take that Field Season 2012)
- Police Reports/Equipment Stolen/Car Accidents - ZERO (again, take that 2012)
- Federal Shutdowns - One too many

- Games of Dominion/Settlers of Catan/Munchkin: Far to Many to Count
- Pounds of Bacon Consumed - at least 1/week

It was crazy, and full of problems all along the way but now it's over and we've got some good data and I am extremely grateful to my amazing technicians who put up with me all fall and did such an excellent job.

Here's to many lessons learned, and good times had, and to hopefully a much more successful field season 2014 next year.......
