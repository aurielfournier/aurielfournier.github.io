If you are a regular reader the topic of my most recent paper won't be too surprising. Dr. Alex Bond and I have written an editorial in The Wildlife Society Bulletin entitled [Volunteer Field Technicians Are Bad for Wildlife Ecology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.603/abstract). 

If you aren't able to access it because of the paywall (Alex and I weren't able to fork over open access fees out of our own pockets, sorry) check out [research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283791283_Volunteer_Field_Technicians_Are_Bad_for_Wildlife_Ecology) for a copy for your personal use. 

Once it comes out in hard copy (right now its online only) Alex and I are planning to write up a follow up blog post addressing some of the responses we've received. 

If you'd like engage us in some dialogue shoot me an email (aurielfournier@gmail.com). If you want to write me an anonymous email telling me that my career is over, you can join the others in my trash bin.
