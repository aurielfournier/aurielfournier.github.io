I'm thrilled to be selected for the 2020 [BioOne Ambassador Award](http://www.bioonepublishing.org/BioOneAmbassadorAward/2020/AMVF.html), for my 2019 paper in Waterbirds, which presented the results of my three year wetland management experiment in Missouri examining the impacts of water level management during autumn migration on rails and waterfowl.
