This week I attended the 60th meeting of the International Association of Great Lakes Researchers. I was invited to give a talk as part of the science communication symposium, which was very fun. Slides are available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/_MORails_MOScience_Tweeting_Live_From_The_Field/4726312).

I also gave a poster about the one Great Lakes rail project I've done, in collaboration with Black Swamp Bird Observatory. Poster also up on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Comparison_of_Arrival_Dates_of_Rail_Migration_in_the_Southwest_Lake_Erie_Marshes/4726315).
