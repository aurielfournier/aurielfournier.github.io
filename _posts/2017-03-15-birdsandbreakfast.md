Education is a vital part of the research cycle and I am always looking for opportunities to get the public involved in whatever I am doing, because if they are not invested in our research and our natural resources, we’re not going to have these amazing animals and places to continue to study and explore. 

During my PhD I coordinated monthly bird banding programs at Hobbs State Park, "Birds and Breakfast" to groups of 40-180 people. Click on the below image for a video by Arkansas State Parks about Birds and Breakfast!

Looking for an enthusiastic scientist to speak to your class, group or organization about ecology, birds, science or science careers? Just let me know (auriel@illinois.edu). If you’re near me I’ll come to you, or we can try to set up something over Skype!
