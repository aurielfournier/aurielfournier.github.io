title: 2013 Annual Coop Report
---

In April all of the students in the [Arkansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](http://www.coopunits.org/Arkansas/) presented to our cooperators on our projects for the 2013 fiscal year. Its a great way for all of us get feedback and make sure that our projects are still answering the questions that started the projects.

Part of this meeting every year is our annual report, which you can read [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/file-storage.DEPARTMENT-ACTIVITIES.digitalmeasures.usgs.edu/arkansas/unit_docs/2013%20Annual%20Report%20Complete-1.pdf). Between all 12 of us we work on everything from water flow regimes, crayfish, bass, mice, turkeys, rails, geese and many things in between.
