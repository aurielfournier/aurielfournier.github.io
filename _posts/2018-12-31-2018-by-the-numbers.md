2018 was my first full year of post grad school employment, and was an action packed whirlwind that included the most non-field work related travel I've ever done for a job, which I simultaneously loved and really took a tole on my physical and mental health, something I've focused on more in the later half of the year. I learned that I can, and am quite good at wrangling big teams into writing big grant applications, that it is ok to say no sometimes, and that Black Rails are real. I didn't accomplish [many of the things](http://aurielfournier.github.io/2018-goals/) I set out last January, but I did learn how better disconnect from work at the end of the day, to celebrate failures, lean into rejections and how to leave my laptop behind and be present. 

As much as my scientific training has taught me to make [SMART](https://www.50minutes.com/title/smart-criteria/) goals, looking back over 2018 I see my successes in the places that I learned to adapt, grow, and be flexible, rather then the metrics I designed for myself a year ago. Here's to learning to be resilient, finally feeling like I deserve a seat at the table, and to learning to be kind to myself.
