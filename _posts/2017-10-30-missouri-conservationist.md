As a long time fan of the Missouri Conservationist, the magazine produced by Missouri Department of Conservation, it is a real treat to see my work on the cover. I wrote a cover story article with Doreen Mengel and Lisa Webb detailing the rail work that has been going on during spring and autumn migration in Missouri the past 5 years.
