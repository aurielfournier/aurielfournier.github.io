#### Image Description Bar Chart, showing that I applied for 40 jobs, and was not interviewed for 36 of them. Of the 4 I was interviewed for, I received 2 offers. 


### This is the data for the job search that resulted in my position at the Illinois Natural History Survey. 

I will preface these graphs by saying, this job search was for me very different then when I was looking for my first post doc. I balanced applying for jobs, with applying for grants that would have extended my postdoc position. If I hadn't been trying to extend my postdoc, I would have spent my time differently, and probably would have applied for more jobs.

#### Image Description - Bar Chart, showing I applied for 17 jobs total. 9 of which I did not get an interview for. 4 of which I never heard back from at all. 4 of which I was interviewed for. I received 2 offers from those interviews, and I accepted the job at INHS before hearing back from the other two (so I do not know if I would have received an offer). 

I applied for a variety of kinds of jobs as well.

#### Image description - four types. 1 instructor position, 5 permanent non-academic positions. 3 permament non-TT positions. and 8 postdoc positions. 

Permanent non-TT positions are permanent jobs that are not Tenure Track but are at a university (such as the position I ended up accepting).

Permament non-academic, includes permament jobs that were not at universities, including non-profit, federal and state agency jobs. 

I also applied for jobs across several US states. My job search was geographically limited in that I was only applying for jobs that were within a 1 hour drive of atleast one place my husband would be able to work. Which eliminated a lot of jobs.
