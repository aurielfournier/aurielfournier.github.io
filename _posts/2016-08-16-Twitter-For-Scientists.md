Rebecca Heiseman, Beth Ross, Desiree Narango, Jordan Rutter and myself did a short workshop at the North American Ornithological Conference Tuesday, highlighting the many ways twitter can be used by scientists. 

Nicole Wood was kind enough to record it for us and the entire workshop, starting with the first half all about how to have a great conference presentation is available here: [https://www.periscope.tv/w/1ynJOzDbEgvGR](https://www.periscope.tv/w/1ynJOzDbEgvGR)
