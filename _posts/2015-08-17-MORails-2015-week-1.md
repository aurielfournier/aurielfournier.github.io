title: MORails 2015 Week 1 - The rails are here!
---

Well we are one week in, and things are going just as smoothly as they possibly could. We've already had both truck and ATV issues (including a flat tire on the first day!) but such is the way this project goes. 

Goal 1 - understand rail migration and wetland management

Goal 2 - provide additional evidence for Murphy's Law

Migration is up and running, the wetland managers were seeing Sora before we started and we are seeing more every night. Which is fantastic because it makes training my technician much easier since she has many chances to see rails and get a solid search image in her brain for what is and is not a Sora. 

This week we will move from the NW Region of Missouri to the NC Region. Our study sites are broken down into four regions and we move between regions every five days. This allows us to look at how the rails respond to wetland management across the state and across the fall season. By the end of October we will be visiting each region four times. 

We're just starting to capture rails this week, next weeks' update should have more photos and hopefully some great video of our surveys.
