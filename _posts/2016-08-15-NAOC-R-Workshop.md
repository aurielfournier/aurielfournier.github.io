Building off the success of the workshop Matt Boone and I taught at AOU in 2015 I taught a full day R workshop on programming, functions, data management and how to build an R package at the North American Ornithological Conference this year. Had 60+ participants and everyone learned a ton. Hoping to tweak it again, improve it some more and teach it again at AOU in 2017.
