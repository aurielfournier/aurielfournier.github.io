I was elected the 2nd Vice President of the [Wilson Ornithological Society](wilsonsociety.org/) this past weekend and will be searching the society and those who study and conserve birds more broadly for the next two years.

I'm very excited for the opportunities this provides to help make the society better as we continue to strive to be a supportive, mentoring and student focused membership society for all those involved in the conservation and study of birds. 

If you have ideas of how WOS can improve, I'm all ears!
