I'm a fairly goal oriented person, I've been setting them, almost annually for some time (not sure what happened in 2015)
[2013](http://aurielfournier.github.io/Goals-for-2013/) - [2014](http://aurielfournier.github.io/goals-for-2014/) - [2016](http://aurielfournier.github.io/2016-goals/) - [2017](http://aurielfournier.github.io/2017-goals/) - [2018](http://aurielfournier.github.io/2018-goals/) - [2019](http://aurielfournier.github.io/2019-goals/)

Starting last year I did less of a laundry list of things, as I was finding that the laundry list wasn't turning out to be very motivating, in part because grad school post doc life gave me control in some areas but not in others. My other ways of [organizing my time/goals](http://aurielfournier.github.io/how-i-stay-organized/) results in those goals changing from month to month and so these longer term goals weren't as effective. Now that I'm in a permament job I'm still working on how to set these longer term goals, for myself, for my research program (what a weird phrase to have come out of my fingers), for the station, but here are some guardrails, to guide me in 2020. 

Continue to fight against injustice and for equity, stay informed, voice my opinion, do [work worth doing](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/824611-the-greatest-gift-life-has-to-offer-is-the-opportunity). 

Keep learning how to be a good manager, supervisor, adviser, mentor and director. 

Only say YES to things I am truely excited about.

Take care of myself so I can fight the [demons](https://lucybellwood.com/100-demon-dialogues/).

Continue to celebrate failures, [rejections](http://aurielfournier.github.io/rejection/) AND successes.
