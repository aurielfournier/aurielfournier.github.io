title: 2015 goals
---

So every year I try to set goals, some are pretty big, ambitious ones, others more reasonable (Here are my lists from <a href="http://aurielmvfournier.com/2013/01/goals-for-2013/">2013</a> and <a href="http://aurielmvfournier.com/2014/01/goals-for-2014/">2014</a>). As you can see, I do not reach all my goals, not by a long shot in many cases.

2014 was no exception, but looking back over that list, remembering where I was a year ago, I am glad for the progress I made, and the many things I did/learned/accomplished that I never thought of a year ago. <strong>Plus I passed my comps, so what does it all matter, I'm a PhD Candidate now :)</strong>

This years goals are much more realist I think, The next year and a half or perhaps two years are going to be pretty intense finishing my PhD, and many things on this list are focused on that.

My 5k goal faltered hard in 2014, due to some health issues, but I think this year I can do it no problem.

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b style="line-height: 20px;">Be able to run 5k by the end of the year - </b><span style="line-height: 20px;">I need to start exercising more, grad school is MUCH less active then field work or even my undergrad. I need to get up and moving more, weekend hiking isn't cutting it. </span></span>

<strong>Visit 3 new states</strong> (Remaining: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Washington, Alaska, North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota, Idaho, Montana and Colorado) (I used to say all states by 25 (which will be this coming June) but that isn't going to happen)

<strong>Every new project will be done as reproducibly as possible,</strong> started and maintained in git so that future me, or future other researchers don't have to reinvent my wheel.
