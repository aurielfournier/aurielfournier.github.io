Drymon, JM, Feldheim, K, Fournier, AMV, Seubert, E, Jefferson, A, Kroetz, A, Powers S [*Tiger sharks eat songbirds: scavenging a windfall of nutrients from the sky*](https://github.com/aurielfournier/aurielfournier.github.io/blob/master/_pdfs/Drymon_et_al_Fournier_2019_Ecology.pdf) **Ecology** 10.1002/ecy.2728

New paper out today in Ecology, which represents a super fun side project I've been working on for the past year or so. I became a part of the project because I eat lunch most days with members of Marcus Drymon's lab, and they were talking about how the Tiger Sharks they were catching had birds in their stomachs. 

The exact mechanism of why this is happening needs further study, but a variety of Gulf of Mexico migratory birds are ending up in Tiger Shark's stomachs, mostly during autumn migration. Which is a connection between terrestrial and marine creatures that hasn't been documented at this scale previously and would be a fascinating area for future research.
