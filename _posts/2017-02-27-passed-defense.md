I am thrilled to announce that I succesfully passed my PhD Defense last Friday, now I just need to address a few edits from my committee and my dissertation and PhD will be complete. 

I was able to live stream my public defense presentation via YouTube Live, and it is recorded there if anyone is interested in watching.
