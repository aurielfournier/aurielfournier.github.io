So the federal government shutdown Tuesday, this probably isn't ground breaking news to anyone but I've been seeing a lot of discussion and comments from a wide variety of people, some of which seem to believe that this won't have any impact on them or anyone they know. A lot of these people are outdoor enthusiasts, birders, and other people who enjoy spending time outside. As a student who's project has been heavily effected by this shutdown I thought I'd just provide my example, for what its worth.



So I am a PhD student with the Arkansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, which is a cooperative between the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Arkansas and the Wildlife Management Institute. Most of the equipment that I use as part of my project is owned by the federal government (USGS) or the state (U of Arkansas). With the closing of the federal government I can't use any of that federal equipment. That includes both of our trucks, one of our trailers, and a bunch of smaller equipment, some of it including safety equipment. I also can't access four of my twelve study sites (because they are national wildlife refuges, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). So me and my techs are essentially stranded until the government opens only being able to work at the conservation area where we are staying (instead of moving around the state every five days like we're suppose to) or we have to find alternate vehicles, the ones available to us won't be able to haul all of our ATVs, which reduces are ability to survey at full capacity. I also have an ATV that needs a part replaced, but I can't get to the store to buy it. 



So it sucks, it adds more challenges on a weird season already, and fortunately (for the birds) congress can't keep the birds from migrating, so we're just spinning our wheels, trying to do our best to get as much done as we can with just our ATVs (luckily state owned).




I'm not the only one affected, or even the most affected, luckily myself and my technicians are still getting paid and we have state housing we can stay in. We stocked up on groceries and gas for the ATVs before the shutdown so we're good for awhile, but its still very frustrating and I hope for my sake and the sake of the many fine federal employees I know that are furloughed that this will be resolved soon.
