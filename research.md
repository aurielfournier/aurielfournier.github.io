# Current Project
Effects of Wetland Management Strategies on Habitat Use of Fall Migrating Rails in Intensively Managed Wetland Complexes in Missouri

My doctoral research is looking at the effects of wetland management on migratory rails during their fall migration. I’m working on state and federal wetlands across the state of Missouri. We do nocturnal spotlight surveys on ATVs to try to observe the use of these wetlands by our five study species (Sora, Virginia Rail, Yellow Rail, King Rail and Black Rail). I had my first field season in the fall of 2012 and it was a huge success, for a brief summary check out my part of the Coop’s 2012 report. Despite my equipment’s best efforts we had a successful 2013 season as well, brief summary here in the Coop’s 2013 report.

We’re also trying to better understand the timing of these birds during fall migration, as well as looking at the nuts and bolts of our survey method and trying to quantify the probability of detection with this method for each species of rail.

We’ve got a few side projects as well, looking at Yellow Rails. We’re going to be collecting blood for some genetic analysis and also taking body measurements for the development of a morphometric model to predict their sex. If you capture Yellow Rails as part of your work and would be willing to take some body measurements, please let me know (aurielfournier@gmail.com)

For all rail species we are collecting feathers for stable isotope analysis with the hope that the Hydrogen and Oxygen signatures in the birds feathers will allow us to better understand the catchment area of our Missouri sites and help us better understand how rails use the Mississippi and Central Flyways.
