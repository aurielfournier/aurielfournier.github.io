I recently completed my PhD in Biology at the [University of Arkansas](www.uark.edu) through the [Arkansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](http://www.coopunits.org/Arkansas/). For the next two years I'll be a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at Mississippi State University working on Structured Decision Making tools to support the [Gulf of Mexico Avian Monitoring Network](https://globalchange.ncsu.edu/secsc/projects/measuring-effects-of-restoration-and-ecological-change-on-bird-populations-in-the-gom/), where I'll be supervised by Drs. Jim Lyons and Mark Woodrey. 

I am a scientist who reaches across the boundary of quantitative and field ecology to answer robust and innovative scientific questions and provide valuable data to support on the ground conservation. In general, my work focuses on the migration ecology of secretive marsh birds and how wetland management impacts them. I have a particular interest in using innovative quantitative techniques to overcome issues of detection to answer continental scale questions about migration, especially for wetland species. My goal is to understand how species migrate, select habitat, and how available habitat throughout their annual cycle may limit their population growth and individual survival. 

Secretive marsh birds provide a great system to ask these questions as well as an opportunity to bridge the gap between consumptive and non consumptive wildlife enthusiasts and unite them behind wetland conservation and management actions, especially in the face of climate change. My research has frequently employed large scale collaboratively generated data sets, either from field projects, or museums, which allow us to ask more robust questions about a species then I could answer on my own.

Part of my research is connecting what I do back to the public. I believe that the only way we can maintain our natural resources and have them in the future is to connect the public to them, and show them how valuable they are while also collecting data so we can make science based conservation decisions. We need to connect everyone with our natural resources and we _need_ diverse stakeholders to be invested in our environmental future. Because of this I judge in the local science fairs, presenting on my research to local groups and high school students and helping lead educational programs at the state park while also trying to help affect change towards making science as a whole a more inclusive place to be. If you are a teacher, I’m always happy to speak to your class or organization about bird migration, ecology and conservation (in person or over Skype).

In addition, we need a diverse workforce studying and managing that environment (and I mean more then just gender diversity). I work towards raising the field of ecology's awareness of the detrimental impact of things like unpaid internships and unfair hiring practices which discriminate against many who want to enter science.  

My goal is to do work that promotes bird conservation and to help connect the people around me with the natural world. I love spending time in the field, and I love writing code, so I’m trying to weave together a career to help birds and keeps me doing my two favorite things. I also really enjoy teaching people about programming and statistics. I am an instructor for [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) and I love sitting down with most anyone to teach them about R, reproducible research and statistics.
