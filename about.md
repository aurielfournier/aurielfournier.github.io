I’m Auriel Fournier and I’m currently pursuing a PhD in Biology at the University of Arkansas through the [Arkansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](http://www.coopunits.org/Arkansas/).

My research is looking at secretive marshbirds, specifically rails and trying to better understand their fall migration and habitat use as it relates to active wetland management, especially in mid-latitude states in the U.S., like Missouri.

My professional interests focus around wetlands and birds, especially migration but also delve into remote sensing, GIS, stable isotopes and statistical modeling. I’m an avid birder and outdoor enthusiast. I’ve been a licensed bird bander since I was 18 and volunteering at banding stations since I was 12. I love any opportunity to help ignite others interest in nature. I want a career where I can make a difference for birds and bird conservation, where that will take me, we’ll see.

I’ve had some wonderful opportunities to travel and work on fascinating projects and I hope to continue to be part of these projects as well as work on helping others have the same chances. I really enjoy helping to mentor up and coming wildlife ecologists, be it my field technicians or undergraduates.

I believe that the only way we can maintain our natural resources and have them in the future is to connect the public to them, and show them how valuable they are. Because of this I volunteer my time doing citizen science, judging in the local science fairs, presenting on my research to local groups and high school students and helping lead educational programs at the state park.

My goal is to do work that promotes bird conservation and to help connect the people around me with the natural world. I love spending time in the field, and I love writing code, so I’m trying to weave together a career to help birds and keeps me doing my two favorite things.

If you’re a teacher, I’m always happy to speak to your class or organization about bird migration, ecology and conservation (in person or over Skype). If you’re a journalist, I’m always happy to answer questions for your story.
