**Pass my Comprehensive Examinations - If I accomplish nothing else this year but this it will be a huge success.**

Work Less - I find that I spend a lot of my time doing things that feel productive, but aren't. I want to streamline my workflow so that I can get more done during 'business hours' and not work so much on the evenings/weekends. Work/Life balance is important, even when I love my work.

Stop changing organization/productivity systems - I am a productivity nerd and an early adapter, I have realized lately, to a fault. Unless I have to change to a new system (being forced by school or some other entity) I'm going to stick with the apps/software/services I currently use. 

I want to be able to run a 5k by the end of the year - I need to start exercising more, grad school is MUCH less active then field work or even my undergrad. I need to get up and moving more, weekend hiking isn't cutting it. 

Visit 10 new states  
     Larger Goal - Visit All 50 States by the time I'm 25 (June 2015)  
     Remaining States (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Washington, Alaska, North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Colorado)
