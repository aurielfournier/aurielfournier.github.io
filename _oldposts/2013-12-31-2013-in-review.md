2013 was a very good year, both personally and professionally.

I got my first paper published and finished my first year of graduate school. Despite all the challenges I had a solid second field season. Feeding my travel bug I was able to travel almost every month of the year, saw some amazing birds and met some amazing people. I have to say I am quite satisfied, even though I didn't complete all the goals I set last January.

So here's 2013 by the numbers, since my scientist self always needs to quantify things.

Miles Traveled by Car - 30,000 (ballpark estimate)
Flights - 14
number of Educational Presentations - 5
number of  National Parks - 4
number of National Wildlife Refuges - 10
Bird Species Seen - 394
number of Lifers (Bird species I'd never seen before) - 164!
States Visited 19
States which were new 6 (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska)
