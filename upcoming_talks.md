Interested in having me speak for your group? I give engaging talks that aim to get people excited about birds, especially wetland birds, and their habitats. I often speak to non-technical audiences, from K-12 classrooms, to mixed age groups, to senior citizen organizations. Drop me a line if you'd like to bring me in to speak to your group!
