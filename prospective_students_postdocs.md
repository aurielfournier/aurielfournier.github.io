title: Prospective Students and Postdocs
permalink: /prospective/

As Director of [Forbes Biological Station](https://www.inhs.illinois.edu/fieldstations/forbes/) and an Assistant Research Scientist with the [Illinois Natural History Survey](https://www.inhs.illinois.edu/) I will in the forseeable future be able to have graduate students and post docs. 

At Forbes and amongst those who work with me, how we science, and treat teach other, is an important part of doing good science. I will work with each student and post doc to ensure that we have clear expectations of what they need from me and vise versa. 

Given my interests in the application of decision science to natural resources problems I am not interested in only wetland and bird related questions. 

[T.J. Benson] and I are hiring a Master's student to work on wetland birds in Illinois. More details [Here](http://aurielfournier.github.io/ms-student-ad/)

While I do not currently have any funding for postdocs, I am happy to collaborate on proposals for funding with interested candidates. Please send me an email (auriel@illinois.edu) expressing your interest along with your CV.
