title: Prospective Students and Postdocs

As Director of [Forbes Biological Station](https://www.inhs.illinois.edu/fieldstations/forbes/) and an Assistant Research Scientist with the [Illinois Natural History Survey](https://www.inhs.illinois.edu/) I will in the forseeable future be able to have graduate students and post docs. 

At Forbes and amongst those who work with me, how we science, and treat each other, is an important part of doing good science. I will work with each student and post doc to ensure that we have clear expectations of what they need from me and vise versa. 

Given my interests in the application of decision science to natural resources problems I am not interested in only wetland and bird related questions. 

Graduate students at Forbes can be academically based either at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign or Western Illinois University, which a given student is based at will depend in part on the student, and also the funding source. 

While I do not currently have any funding for students/postdocs, I am happy to collaborate on proposals for funding with interested candidates. Please send me an email (auriel@illinois.edu) expressing your interest along with your CV.
