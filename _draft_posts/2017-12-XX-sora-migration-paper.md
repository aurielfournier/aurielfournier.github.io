New paper out in the Wilson Journal of Ornithology 

Fournier, A.M.V., Mengel, D.C., Gbur, E.E., Krementz, D.G. The timing of autumn Sora (Porzana carolina) migration in Missouri Wilson Journal of Ornithology 129:675-770 [PDF]

Sora are the most commonly encountered rail during my PhD work, we observed over 8 thousand of them. When I originally started my project back in 2012 we didn't have a good feel for when Sora were migrating through Missouri, and my first field season ended October 7th because we thought migration would be over then. 

October 7, 2012 rolled around and we quickly realized that was not the case, so for the next four field seasons we surveyed into the end of October, when numbers started to drop off. 

While we did observe some variation in the distribution of Sora across the migratory season, overall the shape is similar, and the median date of migration is the same across all four years presented in this paper (2012-2015). This suggests that Sora migration may be driven or initiated by changes in day light rather then weather. 

We also detected Sora migrating in Missouri much earlier in August then pervious work, which is very exciting and points to the importance of using methods which maximize detection for detecting
