## Low Points

Losing my amazing Opa (grandfather), who has left us huge shoes to fill in the continued fight for the rights of everyone, especially those with mental illness or who have suffered loss in their lives. This was my seventh Christmas without my Dad, and my first without his dad, my Opa, I have spent a lot of time thinking about how to live up to both of their great legacies.
