title: Rejection - A constant companion in science
permalink: /rejection/

One thing often hidden behind a person's CV is the amount of rejection that comes with succeeding in science, regardless of how a person is trying to succeed (publish a paper, get a job, obtain a grant, etc). Below is a graphic showing the history of my published and unpublished papers and their rejection histories. 

For those who are less familiar with academic publishing, a desk rejection is where the editor of the journal rejects the paper without sending it out for peer review (often because they do not think it fits with the scope of the journal).

My hope is by sharing this kind of information (I'm working on digging up data on grants and jobs), we can all realize that rejection is our constant companion, and while its totally fine to be disapointed, its not a reason to doubt your abilities.
